userRouter.get("/:id", getUser);
userRouter.get("/all", getAllUser);


## Technologies Used

## Front-end:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Back-end:

Node.js
Express.js
Database:

MongoDB (assumed based on the DBConnect module)
External APIs and Libraries:

Google Maps API
Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies by running npm install in the project root directory.
Set up the required environment variables. Create a .env file in the project root directory and provide the necessary values.
Start the server by running node app.js or npm start.
Access the application by navigating to http://localhost:8181 in your web browser.
## Usage
Once the server is running and you access the application, you will see a web page with the following components:

A header section displaying an image, shoe details, price, and an "Order Now" button.
A Google Map section showing a default location or a searched location (based on the entered city).
A search input field and a search button to search for a specific location.
## Ordering Process
Clicking the "Order Now" button triggers a payment order.
The client sends a POST request to http://localhost:8181/payment/order to retrieve the order information.
The response contains the required details, including the order ID.
The Razorpay library is initialized with the order details, and a payment window is opened.
The user can complete the payment process within the opened window.
## Searching for Locations
Enter a location in the search input field.
Click the search button to initiate the search.
The application will display the entered location on the map.
The map will be embedded within an iframe using the Google Maps API.
